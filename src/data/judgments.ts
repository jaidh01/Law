    title: 'Supreme Court: Suit For Partition Of HUF Property Binds Subsequently Born Coparceners',
    slug: 'supreme-court-partition-huf-property-binds-subsequently-born-coparceners',
    summary: 'The Supreme Court has held that a decree in a suit for partition of HUF property binds coparceners born subsequent to the filing of the suit.',
    content: `The Supreme Court has held that a decree in a suit for partition of Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) property binds coparceners born subsequent to the filing of the suit.

    A three-judge bench comprising Justices UU Lalit, S. Ravindra Bhat, and Sudhanshu Dhulia was deciding a reference on the question of whether a preliminary decree in a partition suit would bind a coparcener born after the suit was filed but before the final decree was passed.
    
    The court held that once a partition suit is properly instituted with all the necessary parties, the decree passed therein would bind all members of the family, including those born subsequent to the institution of the suit.
    
    "The very purpose of a partition suit is to end the joint status of the family. If coparceners born subsequent to the institution of the suit were allowed to reopen settled shares, it would lead to multiplicity of litigation and render partition suits practically ineffective," the judgment stated.
    
    The court clarified that the rights of coparceners are determined at the time of filing the suit, and subsequent births do not create new rights that can disturb the division already proposed or decreed.
    
    The bench distinguished between the right of a coparcener to claim partition, which accrues at birth, and the actual partition of property, which crystallizes the shares at a specific point in time.
    
    "While it is true that under Hindu law, a son acquires by birth an interest in the ancestral property of the joint family, this right is subject to procedural regulations, including the rule that a partition once set in motion through a properly instituted suit binds all members, present and future," the court observed.
    
    The judgment also addressed the concept of representation, noting that in a partition suit, the existing coparceners represent not only themselves but also the entire estate, including the interests of future generations.
    
    The court emphasized that this principle does not violate the property rights of subsequently born coparceners, as it is a necessary procedural rule to ensure finality in property disputes.
    
    This judgment resolves a longstanding ambiguity in Hindu succession law and provides clarity on the binding nature of partition decrees on future generations.`,

    title: 'Delhi High Court: Mere Delay In Investigation Not Ground For Quashing FIR In Serious Offences',
    slug: 'delhi-hc-delay-investigation-not-ground-quashing-fir-serious-offences',
    summary: 'The Delhi High Court has ruled that mere delay in investigation cannot be a ground for quashing an FIR, particularly in cases involving serious offences.',
    content: `The Delhi High Court has ruled that mere delay in investigation cannot be a ground for quashing an FIR, particularly in cases involving serious offences.

    Justice Subramonium Prasad, while dismissing a petition seeking quashing of an FIR in a case of alleged cheating and forgery, observed that courts should be extremely cautious in exercising their power to quash FIRs on the ground of delay in investigation.
    
    The petitioner had sought quashing of an FIR registered in 2018 under Sections 420, 467, 468, and 471 of the Indian Penal Code on the ground that despite the passage of five years, the investigation had not been completed, and no chargesheet had been filed.
    
    The court noted that while expeditious investigation is desirable, delay by itself cannot be a ground for quashing an FIR, especially when serious offences are involved and the delay is not attributable to malafides.
    
    "The power to quash an FIR is to be exercised sparingly and with circumspection. When serious offences like forgery and cheating are alleged, the court should be reluctant to quash the FIR merely on the ground of delay," Justice Prasad observed.
    
    The court distinguished between delay in filing an FIR and delay in completing the investigation, noting that the latter may occur due to various factors including the complexity of the case, availability of evidence, or workload of investigating agencies.
    
    "While inordinate and unexplained delay in investigation may be a relevant factor in some cases, it cannot by itself be a ground for quashing an FIR unless it is shown that the delay was malafide or has resulted in grave prejudice to the accused that cannot be remedied during trial," the judgment stated.
    
    The court further observed that in cases involving documentary evidence, complex financial transactions, or multiple accused persons, investigations naturally take longer, and the court should not interfere merely because the investigation is not proceeding at the desired pace.
    
    Justice Prasad directed the investigating agency to complete the investigation within three months and file a report before the trial court.
    
    The judgment provides important clarity on the limited grounds on which FIRs can be quashed and reinforces the principle that procedural delays should not come in the way of substantive justice, particularly in cases involving serious offences.`,

    title: 'Supreme Court: Unregistered Agreement To Sell Not Inadmissible As Evidence',
    slug: 'supreme-court-unregistered-agreement-sell-not-inadmissible-evidence',
    summary: 'The Supreme Court has clarified that an unregistered agreement to sell is not inadmissible as evidence under Section 49 of the Registration Act.',
    content: `The Supreme Court has clarified that an unregistered agreement to sell is not inadmissible as evidence under Section 49 of the Registration Act, 1908.

    A bench comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjay Kumar was hearing an appeal against a judgment of the Rajasthan High Court which had held that an unregistered agreement to sell could not be looked into for any purpose, including proof of oral agreement or possession.
    
    The Supreme Court overruled the High Court's interpretation, holding that an agreement to sell does not require mandatory registration under Section 17 of the Registration Act, and therefore, the bar under Section 49 regarding admissibility of unregistered documents does not apply to such agreements.
    
    "An agreement to sell only creates a right to obtain another document, namely, the sale deed. It does not by itself create or transfer any interest in immovable property. Therefore, it does not fall within the ambit of Section 17(1)(b) of the Registration Act," the court observed.
    
    The bench distinguished between documents that create immediate rights in immovable property (which require mandatory registration) and those that merely create a right to obtain another document (which do not require registration).
    
    "Section 49 of the Registration Act makes unregistered documents inadmissible for the purpose of affecting immovable property or conferring power to adopt. This provision operates only when the document requires compulsory registration under Section 17. Since an agreement to sell does not require compulsory registration, Section 49 does not render it inadmissible," the judgment stated.
    
    The court further clarified that while registration of an agreement to sell may be desirable for better protection of the purchaser's interests, the absence of registration does not affect its admissibility as evidence.
    
    "An unregistered agreement to sell can be admitted in evidence to prove:
    1. The existence of an oral agreement between the parties
    2. The nature of the transaction
    3. The possession of the property by the intended purchaser
    4. Other collateral matters such as the payment of consideration," the court held.
    
    The Supreme Court set aside the High Court's judgment and remanded the matter for fresh consideration in light of the legal position clarified in the judgment.
    
    This judgment provides much-needed clarity on the admissibility of unregistered agreements to sell and will have significant implications for property transactions and related litigation across the country.`,

    title: 'Calcutta High Court: Adopted Child Has Same Rights As Biological Child In Ancestral Property',
    slug: 'calcutta-hc-adopted-child-same-rights-as-biological-ancestral-property',
    summary: 'The Calcutta High Court has held that an adopted child has the same rights as a biological child in ancestral property under Hindu law.',
    content: `The Calcutta High Court has held that an adopted child has the same rights as a biological child in ancestral property under Hindu law.

    Justice Shampa Sarkar, while deciding a partition suit, ruled that once a valid adoption takes place under Hindu law, the adopted child gets fully integrated into the adoptive family and enjoys the same rights in the ancestral property as a biological child would.
    
    The case involved a dispute between siblings, where the defendants had contested the plaintiff's right to a share in the ancestral property on the ground that he was an adopted son and not entitled to the same rights as the biological children.
    
    The court, relying on Section 12 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, observed that the statute explicitly provides that an adopted child shall be deemed to be the child of the adoptive parents for all purposes from the date of adoption.
    
    "Section 12 of the Act is clear and unambiguous. It states that an adopted child shall be deemed to be the child of his or her adoptive father or mother for all purposes with effect from the date of the adoption and from such date all the ties of the child in the family of his or her birth shall be deemed to be severed and replaced by those created by the adoption in the adoptive family," the judgment noted.
    
    The court emphasized that this provision effectively places the adopted child in the same position as a biological child for all legal purposes, including succession and inheritance rights.
    
    Justice Sarkar further observed that the Supreme Court, in several judgments, has reinforced this principle by holding that after a valid adoption, the adoptee becomes a member of the adoptive family for all intents and purposes.
    
    "The only exception to this rule is where a contrary intention is expressed in a will or other testamentary document by a testator. In the absence of such a contrary intention, an adopted child's rights in the ancestral property are identical to those of a biological child," the court stated.
    
    The court also noted that modern Hindu law, as codified in various statutes, has moved away from some of the restrictions that existed in the traditional Hindu law regarding the rights of adopted children.
    
    "The legislative intent behind the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act is to ensure that adopted children are not discriminated against and are treated with the same dignity and accorded the same rights as biological children," Justice Sarkar observed.
    
    The High Court decreed the suit in favor of the plaintiff, holding that he was entitled to an equal share in the ancestral property along with his siblings.`,

    title: 'NCLAT: Operational Creditors Cannot Use IBC As Recovery Mechanism For Disputed Claims',
    slug: 'nclat-operational-creditors-cannot-use-ibc-recovery-mechanism-disputed-claims',
    summary: 'The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal has ruled that operational creditors cannot use the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code as a recovery mechanism for disputed claims.',
    content: `The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has ruled that operational creditors cannot use the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) as a recovery mechanism for disputed claims.

    A two-member bench comprising Chairperson Justice Ashok Bhushan and Technical Member Barun Mitra, while dismissing an appeal against an order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), emphasized that the IBC is not an alternate forum for recovery of debts where there is a genuine dispute regarding the claim.
    
    The case involved an operational creditor who had supplied goods to a corporate debtor. When the corporate debtor raised issues regarding the quality of goods and withheld payment, the operational creditor issued a demand notice under Section 8 of the IBC and subsequently filed an application under Section 9 to initiate insolvency proceedings.
    
    The NCLT had dismissed the application on the ground that there was a pre-existing dispute regarding the quality of goods, which the corporate debtor had raised before the receipt of the demand notice.
    
    Upholding the NCLT's decision, the NCLAT observed that the existence of a dispute before the issuance of a demand notice is sufficient to reject an application under Section 9 of the IBC.
    
    "The IBC is a special statute designed to address insolvency and bankruptcy, not to function as an alternative forum for debt recovery. When there is a genuine dispute regarding the claim, the appropriate forum for resolution is a civil court or arbitration, not the insolvency process," the judgment stated.
    
    The NCLAT clarified the meaning of "dispute" under Section 5(6) of the IBC, noting that it includes not only pending suits and arbitration proceedings but also any communication that raises a genuine dispute regarding the quality of goods or services or the breach of a contractual obligation.
    
    "The dispute should not be illusory, hypothetical, or a mere pretext to avoid payment. However, if there is a plausible contention that requires investigation and the corporate debtor has raised it before receiving the demand notice, the insolvency process should not be initiated," the bench observed.
    
    The NCLAT emphasized that the threshold for determining the existence of a dispute is not whether the dispute will ultimately succeed but whether it is genuine and requires adjudication by an appropriate forum.
    
    "The IBC was enacted to resolve insolvency and not to be used as a pressure tactic by creditors to enforce payment of disputed claims. Allowing operational creditors to use the IBC for recovery of disputed debts would defeat the purpose of the Code and burden the NCLT with matters that are essentially civil disputes," the judgment concluded.
    
    This ruling reinforces the principle that the insolvency process under the IBC should be triggered only when there is clear and undisputed default, not when there are genuine commercial disputes between the parties.`,
